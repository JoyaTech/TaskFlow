# MindFlow Application Overview

## Project Structure

The MindFlow app is structured as a Flutter application using Riverpod for state management. Below is a map of the application's major components:

- **lib/**
  - **main.dart**: Entry point of the application.
  - **services/**
    - **validation_service.dart**: Handles input validation using regular expressions.
    - **google_calendar_service.dart**: Manages Google Calendar integration.
    - **secure_storage_service.dart**: Provides secure storage and retrieval of API keys and other sensitive information.
  - **providers/**
    - **task_providers.dart**: Contains providers for task management, connecting the UI with state and business logic.
  - **screens/**
    - **home_page.dart**: The main screen of the app, featuring a progress section and a calendar view.
    - **search_screen.dart**: Implements the task search functionality.
    - **settings_page.dart**: Manages user settings including API key management.

## Current Issues

1. _Undefined Getter `progress` in `_HomePageState`_
   - The `progress` getter or variable is undefined in the `home_page.dart` file, causing compilation errors.

2. _Invalid Named Parameter `onTaskCompleted`_
   - A named parameter passed to a widget in `home_page.dart` is invalid, leading to a runtime error.

3. _Improper Async Handling_
   - Issues with asynchronous code, such as `await` in non-async methods in `settings_page.dart`.

4. _Static vs. Instance Method Use_
   - Inconsistencies in calling static methods as instance methods in `SecureStorageService`.

5. _Color Scheme Fixes_
   - Use of incorrect method `withValues(alpha: ...)` where `withOpacity(...)` should be applied.

## Recommendations

- Review the `home_page.dart` for undefined variables and incorrect method calls.
- Ensure proper usage of static and instance methods in service classes.
- Handle async/await correctly in all parts of the app.
- Replace improper opacity method calls with `withOpacity(...)`.

This overview provides a snapshot of the current structure and issues within the MindFlow application. It should help new contributors understand where to focus their efforts for improvements.
